`useResponsiveProp` returns a function that takes the `responsive props` format as a first argument. It's useful if you want to resolve responsive props in your components.

### TypeScript

```typescript
const useResponsiveProp: <T>(value: ResponsiveProp<T> | null | undefined) => T | undefined;
```

### ReScript

```res
type resolveResponsiveProp<'a> = option<responsiveProp<'a>> => option<'a>

let useResponsiveProp: unit => resolveResponsiveProp<'a>
```

### Example

```jsx live
function() {
  const ResponsivePlaceholder = props => {
    const resolveResponsiveProp = useResponsiveProp()
    const size = resolveResponsiveProp(props.size)

    return (
      <Placeholder width={size} height={size} />
    )
  }

  return (
    <StacksProvider>
      <ResponsivePlaceholder size={[100, 200, 300]} />
    </StacksProvider>
  )
}
```
